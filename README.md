Simple SEO fields for titles, headings, and descriptions. The title and description fields (`seo_title` and `seo_description`) are displayed automatically. The heading `seo_heading` must be added the (child) theme template manually. The plugin provides the function `cgit_seo_heading()` to output the heading with a fallback to a string of your choice or to a heading based on the page title, site description, and site name.
